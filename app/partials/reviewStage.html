<h2>Review</h2>
<p>
	So, you said '<strong>{{cbtEntry.concern}}</strong>', and this made you feel <strong ng-repeat="emotion in cbtEntry.emotions">{{emotion}}, </strong>
	and you had these thoughts about it:
	<ul>
		<li ng-repeat="(negBelief, distortionList) in cbtEntry.negativeBeliefs">
			<strong >{{negBelief}}</strong>, however, <span ng-show="distortionList['newBelief']">you now think <strong> {{distortionList['newBelief']}}</strong> because</span> you've realised this is:
			<ul>
					<li ng-repeat="(dist, newThought) in distortionList['newThoughts']">
					<span >
						{{dist}}, for these reasons:

						<ul>
							<li><strong>{{newThought}}</strong></li>
						</ul>
						</span>
					</li>

			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
